# 🛒 Honesty Store - UP Diliman Computer Science

Welcome to the **Honesty Store**, the only place where **your conscience is the cashier!**  

Located on the **second floor of the UP Alumni Engineers Centennial Hall**, this self-service mini-store lets you grab snacks, drinks, and maybe a bit of existential guilt if you “forget” to pay.  As one of my initiatives as a UP Diliman Computer Science Representative, this store operates on an honesty-based system, where students take what they need and leave the correct payment.

## 🤪 The Website  
Because running a small store wasn’t chaotic enough, I built a **website** for it - packed with:  
✅ **Peak web design irony**  
✅ **Comic Sans** (yeah...)  

## 🎓 Where Your Money Goes  
Every snack purchase funds **CS Department initiatives**, including:  
- 🚰 The **water station** (hydration = brain function)  
- 📚 **Review sessions** (so we all pass... hopefully)  
- 🎉 **Graduation dinner** (because surviving CS deserves a feast)  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer  
Yes, we trust you. No, this is not an invitation to “beta test” shoplifting. 😆  

Check out the site, and remember: **Honesty is the best policy (but also, please pay for your snacks).**
